# 👨‍💻 About the Author

## ViktorFu

Hi! I'm Viktor, the creator and maintainer of the Whisper Audio/Video Transcriber project.

### 🎯 Project Vision

I created this tool to bridge the gap between AI-powered speech recognition and practical, everyday use. My goal was to make high-quality audio transcription accessible to everyone, from content creators to researchers, with professional-grade precision and user-friendly interfaces.

### 🚀 Technical Focus

- **AI & Machine Learning**: Specializing in audio processing and speech recognition
- **Python Development**: Building robust, scalable applications with clean architecture
- **GPU Computing**: Optimizing performance for CUDA-accelerated workflows
- **Open Source**: Contributing to the community with well-documented, maintainable code

### 🎵 Why Audio Transcription?

Audio and video content is everywhere, but making it searchable and accessible remains a challenge. This project combines the power of OpenAI's Whisper with intelligent preprocessing to deliver:

- Millisecond-precise timestamps
- Multi-language support
- Professional-grade quality
- Easy-to-use interfaces
